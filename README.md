# Auto EDA Library

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a term for certain kinds of initial analysis and findings done with data sets, usually early on in an analytical process. It allows us to uncover patterns and insights, often with visual methods, within data. EDA is often the first step of the data modelling process. It is a way of visualizing, summarizing and interpreting the information that is hidden in rows and column format. ... Once EDA is complete and insights are drawn, its feature can be used for supervised and unsupervised machine learning modelling.
